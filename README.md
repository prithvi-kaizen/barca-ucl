## 📐 Analytical Metrics

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Per Match | `total_metric / matches_played` |
| Contribution Share | `(player_goals + assists) / team_total_goals` |
| Dominance Index | Composite of: goal diff/match (40%), win % (40%), clean sheet % (20%) |

---

## 📊 Data Integrity

> **All data is real, verifiable historical data.**

- ✅ Sourced from UEFA.com, Wikipedia, and FBref
- ✅ No synthetic, generated, or estimated values
- ✅ Missing stats (e.g., possession for 1992) explicitly marked as `null`
- ✅ Every score, scorer, and date is from documented records

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimal and archival** — the interface feels like a digital research notebook
- **Data-first hierarchy** — numbers lead, decorations follow
- **No visual noise** — no gradients, no glow, no decorative sports styling
- **Color palette**: `#F7F7F7` background, `#111111` text, `#1C2A39` navy accent
